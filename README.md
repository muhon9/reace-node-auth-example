## ðŸŽ¯ About

A practise project to implement an authentication system where the backend will send two tokens after login.

The challenge was to call refresh-token after the access token is expired without letting the user feel about it

I used Axios instances to implement it

:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; Used Vite to configure React<br/>
:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; JWT tokens for authorizations<br/>
:heavy_check_mark:&nbsp; For backend I used [NODE EXPRESS BOILERPLATE PROJECT](https://github.com/hagopj13/node-express-boilerplate) <br/>


## Quick Start

To test the project, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/muhon9/react-node-auth-example.git
```

Go to folder node-backend and change the name of .env.example to .env and set your MONGODB_URL and other parameters if you want to change them

Install the dependencies:

```
npm run install-dependencies
```

Run the front and backend concurrently:

```
npm run dev
```
If you want to run them seperately just change the directory and start seperately
